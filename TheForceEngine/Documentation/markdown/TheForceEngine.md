The Force Engine is a project to reverse engineer and rebuild the Jedi Engine for modern systems and the games that used that engine - Dark Forces and Outlaws. The project includes modern, built-in tools, such as a level editor and makes it easy to play Dark Forces and Outlaws on modern systems as well as the many community mods designed to work with the original games.

Playing Dark Forces or Outlaws using the Force Engine adds ease of use and modern features such as higher resolutions and modern control schemes such as mouse-look. Using the built-in tools allows for easier modding with more modern UI, greater flexibility and the ability to use enhancements made to the Jedi Engine for Outlaws in custom Dark Forces levels - such as slopes, stacked sectors, per-sector color maps and more.

Note that this project aims to replace the executables but you will need the original game data to play. This is not a remake but a way to make the original games easier to play on modern systems, to provide optional improvements such as modern controls and higher resolution rendering and to provide enhanced modding support and tools. If you do not already own Dark Forces and/or Outlaws, you will need to purchase them to play them using the Force Engine. Both games are currently available on the Steam and GOG digital stores.
