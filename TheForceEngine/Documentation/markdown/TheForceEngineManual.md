## Getting Started
The first step to using The Force Engine is to purchase and/or install Dark Forces or Outlaws. If you do not own these games, they are currently available at the [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) digital storefronts. The Force Engine will attempt to auto-detect your installations, in which case you can get started immediately. However, if this fails for whatever reason, you will need to setup you game data directories manually. To do this, return to the main menu and then select Settings > Game. You will see your current Game Source Data directories, which may be blank. You will need to select the directory that points to the original game's executable or source data - use the Browse button to bring up the file menu. The dialog will tell you which file(s) to select at the top.

Once your game source data is setup, select your Game to play - Dark Forces is the default. Currently only Dark Forces is seletable but this will be fixed in the future. While in the Settings menus, you can adjust Graphics settings such as game resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode. When finished, select Return to go back to the main menu.

## Settings During Gameplay
Once you Start a game, you will be interfacing with the original game's UI. If you want to change settings, such as Graphics, Sound or Control options, use the **Alt + F1** shortcut to open The Force Engine system UI in-place. This will allow you to return to the main menu (quitting the game) and change settings. Most Graphics options will change the way the game is displayed immediately, which is a great way of tweaking the settings to your liking while seeing the results.
