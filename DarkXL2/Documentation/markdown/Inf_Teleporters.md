# Class: Teleporter
Vanilla Dark Forces has only one teleporter sub-class, the chute. However additional sub-classes may be added in the future to DarkXL 2, so teleporters get their own section.
## chute
This teleports the player to the same horizontal (x, z) position to the target sector but above the floor so that the player continues falling. This type of teleporter is not intended to be noticed but rather a way to fall from one sector to the next as if they were vertically connected.

Because the player gets teleported to the same (x, z) coordinate, the two sectors must be on top of each other. To make visualization and editing easier, they should be in different layers and have different heights.

Make sure to add the **Target** variable to specify the target sector.
